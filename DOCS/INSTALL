BinaryPHP Installation

You may need to change the first line in convert.php to reflect your php binary install.

To find out where the php binary is located use:

mypc $ which php
/usr/bin/php

You can then edit the first line from:

!#/usr/local/bin/php

To:

!#/usr/bin/php

Save and exit the file, to test type ./convert.php and hit enter.

You should see the help information. If you get an error like the following:

-bash: ./convert.php: /usr/local/bin/php: bad interpreter: No such file or directory

Then you have the wrong path in the first line still.
